Website is live at wifind.alvynle.me (06/08/2017)
(subdomain to alvynle.me, which will be the url to my personal website)

Web Hosting Service:  awardspace

Database:

Due to awardspace's limitations regarding remote handling of databases through softwares such as MySQL Workbench, I needed to
export the database onto their database service.

Database credentials change:
host is now "fdb16.awardspace.net"
user, database name, and obviously password change as well.

Main problem:
PHP script (connection_mysql) will not execute properly if not leaving the database credentials embeded into it (internally).

Observations:
Markers appear ~ 5 seconds after page with map is loaded. Probably due to the JS accessing the PHP accessing the Database on
server.
