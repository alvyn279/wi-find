# wi-find
A project that allows users to view free nearby Wi-Fi spots, or at a certain location on a map interface. The features of this website (and eventually mobile application) include a manual input request for users to add fresh new hotspots.

Programming languages and software packages that are made use of are the following:
HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, XML notation, Google Maps Javascript API 

This project not only involves the creation of a website to hold the map and static/dynamic elements. It will eventually be transformed an mobile application on an Android interface.

Note from the creator: My name is Alvyn Duy-Khoi Le and I am currently a first-year student at Concordia University in Software Engineering. My love for computer and programming has brought me to start a project of my own, that was once an idea that became an excellent learning opportunity.
