# wi-find
Feel free to check the progress, at wifind.alvynle.me

A project that allows users to view free nearby Wi-Fi spots, or at a certain location on a map interface. Features of this website (and eventually mobile application) include a manual input request for users to add fresh new hotspots and an up-to-date database of the non-profit & Montreal-based organization Ile-Sans-Fil's Wi-Fi spots.

Programming languages and software packages used:
HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, XML notation, Google Maps Javascript API 

This project not only involves the creation of a website to hold the map and static/dynamic elements. It will eventually be transformed into a mobile application on an Android interface.

Note from the creator: My name is Alvyn Duy-Khoi Le and I am currently a first-year student at Concordia University in Software Engineering. My love for computers and programming has brought me to start a project of my own, that was once an idea that became an excellent learning opportunity.
